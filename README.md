# MiniBot Project

MiniBot is an Unreal Engine project where I focus on learning about procedural animation and inverse kinematics (IK) systems, specifically designed for legged robots or characters. 
The project showcases dynamic body positioning, smooth motion integration, and custom IK solutions. It is an ongoing project and much will change over time.

## Features so far

- **Inverse Kinematics (IK):** Custom IK system for legged characters.
- **Dynamic Step Targeting:** Algorithm for dynamic step placement based on terrain and movement.
- **Smooth Dynamics Integrator:** Utilizes a custom component for smooth transitions and movements.


Created using Unreal Engine version 5.3.2
